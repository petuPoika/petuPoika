## About me and this Github profile
Hello. I am Petteri Castrén from Oulu, Finland.

🧰 I have previously worked in technical sales for about 8 years, focusing on hydraulics, pneumatics, and maintenance products.
Using various ERP systems during this time sparked enthusiasm for developing information systems. This experience also piqued my general interest in programming.

👨‍🎓 I am currently studying information processing science at the University of Oulu
  - Started in 2022
  - Planned graduation in spring 2026
  - Particularly interested in ERP systems and artificial intelligence
  - My interest is in improving the world of information systems from the users' perspective

🏗 Planned future coding projects:
- Develop a small-scale **ERP system** with Java, followed by a mobile version (continuous project)
- Create a **karting data logger system** with Raspberry pi (summer 2025). Including features such as time tracking, temperature monitoring (engine water, exhaust gas, tires), g-force, speed, rpm and a shift light
- Participate in a **university team project**. Program a physical 3D bucket loader that can be simulated in Unreal engine (spring 2025)

👨‍💻 Programming languages:
- Java
- Python
- C
